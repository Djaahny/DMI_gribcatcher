# DMI gribcatcher

## Intro
This little tool was written by "Djaahny", "Bamsen" and ChatGPT - it downloads GeoJson info on wind forecast from DMI.dk's API and converts it a GRIB file that can be used in OpenCPN's grib and weather routing. The software is provided as is - enjoy or don't.  

This files will get grib wind data from DMI's api and convert it to grib data to go into OpenCpn - it will get the entire time lenght of the forecast defined by the bbox coordinates in the file.

## Program Info
Downloads a GeoJSON file and converts it to GRIB2.  
  
options:  
    --help         show this help message and exit  
    --bbox BBOX        Bounding box of area to download - default is: 9.29,54.54,13.04,56.19 (inner inner danish waters).  
    --out-file OUT_FILE  The location of the output file - default: os homedir  

  ### Example for Denmark
    For most of Denmark use this Bounding box:
    `>> python3.11 DMI_EDS2grib.py --bbox=9.11,53.51,15.22,57.46`
    For Sj√¶llannd and Fyn use the default.
